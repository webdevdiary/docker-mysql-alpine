# docker-mysql-alpine
Example of Dockerfile with MySQL installation in Alpine

## How to run:
```
docker-compose up
```

## Description
This is an example of Dockerfile, which includes
Alpine with MySQL client and server.

I should say, that there is no MySQL server available
for Alpine, and we need to use MariaDB server, which
looks like similar in the most cases.
